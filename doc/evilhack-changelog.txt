EvilHack Changelog
============================================================================================

Version 0.1.0
-------------

First version of EvilHack, which was forked off of NetHack 362-hdf as of October 20th, 2018.
Commits from NetHack 3.6.2 beta (vanilla) will be incorporated on a regular basis so as to
stay current with the 3.6.x codebase.

Version 0.1.0 of EvilHack is for the most part laying down the foundation for content from
other sources to be added (primarily GruntHack and Sporkhack), and for new custom content to
be created and implemented.

The following changes to date are:

- Edits to config.h, patchlevel.h, allmain.src, sysconf, Makefiles and hints files to
  differentiate EvilHack from NetHack
- adjust install script for EvilHack for use on public server
- significant merges of latest 'vanilla' NetHack 3.6.2 code
