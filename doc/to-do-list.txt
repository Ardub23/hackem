=========================================================

Currently known issues:
* Shimmering dragons don't have displacement yet <---- FIXED
* Engulf attack from gelatinous cubes and water elementals continue to strangle you even after escaping from inside of them. A fix for this was made for GruntHack - that same fix does not work here <---- FIXED (thanks aosdict)
* Water elemental engulf attack does not affect inventory with water damage <---- FIXED
* Riding a steed that engulfs other monsters throws an error
* Shambling horror 'bad attack type in spitmu' when it uses a spit attack (same behavior with breath attack). Game still progresses. <---- FIXED
* Saving/reloading a game wipes out shambling horror state to default template <---- work-around enabled
* Monster dies while riding its steed. Steed still alive and standing on monsters' corpse. If monster is revived while its steed is standing on its corpse, the steed vanishes completely instead of being re-mounted <---- FIXED
* Resistance gaining messages still occur even when resistance is at 100% <---- FIXED
* Intelligent monsters can use bags and put gear inside of them, but won't take items out <---- FIXED
