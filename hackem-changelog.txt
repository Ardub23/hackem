Dragons and Dragon Scales
	Evil uses the dtsund patch for dragon scales, which means that dragon scale
	mail no longer exists - but we can apply dragon scales to any armor. Evil 
	introduced some passive effects, I have expanded these so that every dragon 
	scale provides them. I have also switched around or added new abilities.
	Most of these abilities are from other forks, but some are my own addition.

	I wanted the Deep Dragon scales to be unique and powerful, so I specifically 
	added immunity to clobber/hurtle attacks

Dragon			Primary				Secondary				Passive
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Black DSM		disintegration res	<<slow digestion>>		passive disintegration attack !!
Blue DSM		shock res			confers speed			<<passive shock attack>> !!
															1d6 and critical hit of 2d24.
Deep DSM		Drain res			clobber/hurtling res	passive drain life
Gold DSM		light 				<<automatic searching>>	<<passive blind attack>>
Gray DSM		magic res			cancel protection		passive cancellation attack !!
Green DSM		poison res			<<sickness res>>		passive poison attack
Orange DSM		sleep res			<<free action>>			<<passive sleep attack>>
Red DSM			fire res			+1d6 melee damage, 		passive fire attack !!
Shimmering DSM	displacement		stealth, warn, see inv	<<passive confusion/stunning/slow>>
Silver DSM		reflection			<<blinding resistance>>	<<Passive reflection scare>>
Sea DSM			magical breathing	swimming				<<passive water/rust attack>> !!
															deals severe halving damage to firey monsters
White DSM		cold res			freeze water/lava walk	passive cold attack !!
Yellow DSM		acid res			stoning resistance		<<passive acid attack>> !!
															1d3 and critical hit of (level + 1)d6

!! - Item destruction from attack AD_TYPE
	- Most of the passive attacks only trigger 33% of the time.
	- Black DSM also protects from engulfing digest attacks due to slow digestion? 
		  (But Not from gelatinous cubes because they have a engulf wrap attack)
	- [SKIPPED] Sea DSM prevents engulfing by firey monsters also.

             */
		- Give monsters 20% instakill rate for wooden stakes
		- Added to-hit bonus of +1
		- Design decision: I'm deviating from slashem here - vampires should not be vulnerable to stakes

Tools/Weapon Tools:
	- [x] lute
	- [x] bagpipe
	- [x] horn of blasting 
	- [x] Torch
		(The slashem implementation of torches was a bit cumbersome for the player, 
		you could only have a lit torch by wielding it. I have tried to address that.)
		- Removed requirement for torches to be wielded -
			(lamps don't need to be wielded, so why would torches?)
		- Unwielding does not snuff the torch.
		- Clubs can be dipped into oil and turned into torches (from dnh)
		- Dwarves in mines frequently get lit torches now.
		- Putting lit torches into containers auto-snuffs.
	- [x] Fishing pole
	- [x] Magic candle
	- [x] Magic lamp: Changed price to 1000
	- [x] keg
	- [x] bag of rats
	- [x] Bag of tricks patch (from UnNethack)
		- The bag of tricks has a bunch of new effects on apply:
			Creates a random object
			You drop the bag
			The bag tries to pull you in
			The bag farts a poison gas clouds
			The bag emits a spore cloud (hallucination)
			The bag scares you (paralyzes)
			The bag bites you
			The bag knocks your weapon to the floor
			The bag makes a monster.
		- When the BoT is empty however, we can start to use it like a normal bag!
		- Adjusted BoT #tip behavior - it stops when it reaches a non-monster effect.
		- This is a compromize between BoT behavior between UnNethack and Evil.
	- [x] masks /* monster type specified by obj->corpsenm */

	
	Lightsabers:
		- [x] Green lightsaber
		- [x] Blue lightsaber
		- [x] Red lightsaber
		- Lit lightsabers act as a light source.
		- We can force locks and break down doors with #force
		- Putting a lit lightsaber into a bag/container snuffs it.
	
	- [x] Pick-axe: Changed weight to 75 aum (From SLASH'EM)

Gems:
	- [x] Healthstone
		- Fixed a bug from SlashEM where healthstones would not work under level 10.
	- [x] Whetstone
		- Made whetstones not suck!
		- We can now apply a stack of whetstones to a stack of weapons. 
		  (Before this was limited to applying 1 whetstone to a single object, 
		  which was cumbersome and annoying to work with.)
		- Can use (a)pply or #rub with whetstones.
		- Removed the extra penalty for artifacts (how can artifacts resist sharpening?)
		- Whetstones can now remove corrosion (in addition to rust)
		- A blessed whetstone can uncurse a weapon
		- Blessed Whetstones can enchant non-corroded, uncursed, +0 weapons up 
		  to +1. (You need to pass a coin flip after the first roll)
		- Cursed whetstones can erode/negatively enchant weapons. 
		  (Only takes 1 turn though)
		- Allow using potions of water, roll 1d7 to see if it's used up.
		- You can use whetstones in shallow water, pools, moats, sewage, 
		  rust traps, sinks, and toilets.
		- Whetstones took a long to use (too long), lowered the time a little.
		- Cavemen get mega bonus for whetstones
		- Updated usage and repair messages
		- Removed the side effects of fountains, sinks, toilets.
		  In SlashEM, using a whetstone on one of these would also activate 
		  the quaffing effects of those features. This duplicates code and also
		  adds too much complexity - after all, we're just using a tiny amount
		  of water to wet the whetstone, would a bunch of Water Moccasins pop
		  out because of that? 
	- Added more upgrade paths for gray stones. 
	- Luckstones and whetstones can be upgraded into healthstones and vice versa. 
	- Flintstones upgrade into luck/whetstones.


Artifacts:
	Design decision #1: 
		In SlashEM, artifacts grant a base damage bonus - should we adjust so 
		that they deal closer to that on average? Currently, we'll say no and
		see how things play out. (Except for Doomblade which I specifically 
		want close to slashem levels.)
	
	Design decision #2: 
		Any roles that had 2 guaranteed altar sacrifice gifts have been reduced to just 1. 
		Having 2 just seems excessive, and most of the time, the second gift was just a barrier to overcome to
		get to better stuff (example: Deathsword for Barbarian, or even Deluder for Wizards)
		
	- [x] Added much stronger artifact blasting (6d6 to 8d10) (from Slashem)

	- [x] Bat from Hell

		- The player/hero can no longer handle thiefbane, even as a chaotic non-human...
		  At first this was a bug, but I decided to keep this because it makes 
		  the Black Market more difficult to steal from and makes more sense 
		  because, of course, Thiefbane would not respect us as thieves!
	- [x] Disrupter
		- Switched Disrupter from being a priest sac gift to being Undead Slayer sac gift.
		- Disrupter causes hostility to undead.
	- [x] Mirrorbright (Healer)
		- Removed Deluder from being a Healer sac gift. It clashes with their quest artifact being 2-handed.
		- Mirrorbright no longer hinders spell-casting.
		- [ ] Idea: Since we made Mirrorbright not hinder spellcasting, we might be able to get away with 1-handed staves...
	- [x] Deluder
		- Removed Deluder from being a Wizard sac gift.
	- [x] Whisperfeet (Tourist)
	- [x] Gauntlets of Defense (Monk)
