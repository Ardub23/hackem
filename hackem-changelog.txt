		- They covet the Amulet of Yendor, and attempt to steal it.
		- Any monster, should it get a hold of the Amulet of Yendor, can and will sacrifice it on an endgame altar.

Monster Mechanic Changes:	
	- [x] Updated nasties lists with slashem monsters. Added gugs, slaughter wights, devas, revenants 
	- [x] Some monsters ride other monsters as steeds, namely The Riders at the endgame.
	- [x] Removed "Hits as +x weapon" property from slashem monsters
	- [x] Removed "Requires +x weapon to be hit" property from slashem monsters
	- [x] BERSERK behavior from evil:
		- Added to many of the imported monsters as felt appropriate
	
	- [x] Many new monster attacks
	- [x] Monster traitor property (M3_TRAITOR): 
		- If tame, these monsters have a chance to betray you.
		- In slashem this used to depend on the monsters HP being lower than yours, but removed that condition.
		  - I also increased the chance of betraying significantly each turn.
		  - Added the traitor property to all monsters that had it in SlashEM/THEM, and related new imported monsters.
	- [x] Implemented Flanking (M2_FLANK) 
		- Monsters with flanking are "tactical"
		- Monsters gain a large bonus to hit when flanking the player (located on opposite sides of
  the player's position).
		- I applied FLANKING from SpliceHack to many appropriate monsters in hackem:
		
		
The zombie – probably the most significant monster change in EvilHack and one of the key changes that makes this variant so difficult. Zombies now have two different attack types, one being a poisonous claw attack (effects and frequency are the same as a bite from a rabid rat), the other being a disease-inducing bite attack to the head. The latter is a very serious threat, as the ability to cure oneself from being terminally ill are almost non-existent in the early game. If the player becomes ill from a zombie bite, they only have a few turns to cure themselves, or they will die and turn into a zombie. This zombie can be encountered by other players if a bones file is generated. There is a very small chance that the player will be able to continue playing if they are turned into a zombie; however, they will be stuck in that form for the remainder of the game. A zombie's bite attack also has a chance of causing amnesia. Eating a zombie corpse will make the player ill and cause them to start turning into a zombie (tins of zombie meat 'cure' the meat and make it safe to eat). Attacking zombies at range and wearing a piece of armor that protects your head are highly recommended. Zombies can make other monsters terminally ill as well - the same methods used by the player to cure themselves of a terminal illness can be used/applied on monsters or pets also - intelligent monsters will seek out these items and use them if necessary.
		
		
Various overall changes – monster hit point generation is now determined by their size as well as what level they are. They also have the same armor class damage reduction that players enjoy. Intelligent monsters can use many more items against the player or for their own benefit, including stashing objects into bags and taking them back out, making a wish (either from the wand, or from a djinni appearing from a used smoky potion), activating any figurines it may have, unlocking and looting locked containers, wearing most rings, scrolls of remove curse to uncurse items in its inventory, scrolls of charging to recharge wands in its possession, and utilizing powerful wands against the player (polymorph and cancellation).

Player monsters are now technically their own class of monster and are separate from how the actual player is defined in src/monst.c, and were purposely left out of the new monsters table as it would unnecessarily inflate that list. Player monsters differ here from vanilla NetHack in that they can spawn outside of the Astral Plane, are yellow in color, and are kitted out in player-like gear starting at level 10, and then can be kitted out with ascension-level gear starting at level 20 – their hit dice and difficulty level roughly matches that of the actual player (this is based off of what experience level the actual player is when the player monster spawns). Their abilities closely match their role as well (wizards and priests can cast spells, rogues can steal items from inventory, etc). Player monster Knights spawn riding either a horse or a warhorse. Player monsters in EvilHack covet the Amulet of Yendor and will attempt to steal it, and if they steal it while on the Astral Plane, will attempt to sacrifice it themselves. As you can imagine, if that happens, it is a game-ending event.


Monster spawn rates
	- increases as you reach various milestones within the game. 
	- 2× once you pass the castle, become crowned, 
		or if you accept the quest before experience level 14.
	- 3× once you pass the first tier demon lord lair.
	- 4× of normal once you pass the first wizard's tower level.
	- 6× of normal once the Wizard of Yendor is killed.
	- 8x once you've performed the invocation,
		Plus all denizens of the dungeon are aware of what has happened, 
		Plus Nasties will spawn on each levels upstairs



Mage spells
- [x] Touch of death
	- if you have MR you'll take damage (8d6) and your maximum hit point level can be reduced slightly. 
	- Having MR and half spell damage together can reduce those effects even more.
- [x] Cancellation (new)
	- Acts just like having a wand of cancellation zapped at the player.
	- The spellcasting monster must be lined up with the player before it can cast this spell.
- [x] Acid blast (new)	
	- A powerful area of effect spell, does acid damage to its target. 
	- The damage output is dependent on the level of the monster casting it. 
	- The acid from this spell also has a chance of eroding any unprotected weapons or armor in open inventory.
- [x] Destroy armor	
	- Vanilla behavior – if the player didn't have magic resistance, one piece of armor would be completely destroyed. 
	- In HackEM, any piece of worn armor can have its fixed status removed, and then deteriorated.
	- Even armor that is normally erodeproof is affected. 
	- Having MR keeps the erosion level at one per cast, otherwise 1-3 levels per cast. 
	- Armor-based quest artifacts are immune to this spell, as is crystal plate mail.
- [x] Fire bolt	(new)
	- A small area of effect spell, this spell explodes a small fireball upon its target.
	- Any flammable objects in open inventory are subject to being burned.
	- low-level spell, any spellcaster has access to it.

	- Any non-protected objects in open inventory are subject to being frozen. 
	- low-level spell, any spellcaster has access to it.
- [x] Reflection (new)
	- Creates a shimmering globe around the caster, granting them reflection for several turns.

Clerical spells:
- [x] Summon minion	(new)
	- Summon a type of minion based on its alignment. 
	- Demons that can cast clerical spells are not given access to this spell (they can already demon-gate).
- [x] Geyser
	- A powerful spell that causes a large geyser of water to slam into its target, causing physical damage (8d6). 
	- What's new: can now rust any unprotected worn armor.
- [x] Vulnerability	 (new)
	- It's target temporarily becomes vulnerable to either fire, cold, shock or acid-based attacks, 
	  dropping its resistance (if any exists) by 50%.

Monster spells
	- [x] Monster spells: Added Create Pool and Call Undead spells (from SlashEM)
	[x] Nerf Call Undead so that chain summoners doesn't happen 
	(no ghoul mages, vampires mages, ghoul queens, L)

Dragons and Dragon Scales
	Evil uses the dtsund patch for dragon scales, which means that dragon scale
	mail no longer exists - but we can apply dragon scales to any armor. Since
	robes are now body armor - we can even created dragon scaled robes! Evil 
	introduced some passive effects, I have expanded these so that every dragon 
	scale provides them. I have also switched around or added new abilities.
	Most of these abilities are from other forks, but some are my own addition.

	I wanted the Deep Dragon scales to be unique and powerful, so I specifically 
	added immunity to clobber/hurtle attacks

															1d3 and critical hit of (level + 1)d6

!! - Item destruction from attack AD_TYPE
- Most of the passive attacks only trigger 33% of the time.
- Black DSM also protects from engulfing digest attacks due to slow digestion? 
  (But Not from gelatinous cubes because they have a engulf wrap attack)

			(lamps don't need to be wielded, so why would torches?)
		- Unwielding does not snuff the torch.

		- Cavemen get mega bonus for whetstones
		- Updated usage and repair messages
		- Removed the side effects of fountains, sinks, toilets.
		  In SlashEM, using a whetstone on one of these would also activate 
		  the quaffing effects of those features. This duplicates code and also
		  adds too much complexity - after all, we're just using a tiny amount
		  of water to wet the whetstone, would a bunch of Water Moccasins pop
		  out because of that? 
	- Added more upgrade paths for gray stones. 
	- luckstones and whetstones can be upgraded into healthstones and vice versa.

		- When the BoT has 0 charges, it is safe to put in a Bag of Holding.
		- Adjusted BoT #tip behavior - it stops when it reaches a non-monster effect.

	- [x] Cursed locking tools (keys/lockpicks/credit cards) have a 20% chance of breaking with each use, whether locking or unlocking. Artifact locking tools are not affected.
	- [x] Object materials – many objects and items can spawn made from something other than its base material.
	- [x] Object properties – various weapons and armor are sometimes created with magical properties.

             * Level 5 = 2d10 fire
             * Level 10 = 3d10 fire - and etc. 
             * Level 15 = 4d10 fire 
             * Level 20 = 5d10 fire (but damage is capped at 45 max)

	[x] spellbook of snowball (new Hack'EM special!)

Artifacts:

	Design decision #1: 
		In SlashEM, artifacts grant a base damage bonus - should we adjust so 
		that they deal closer to that on average? Currently, we'll say no and
		see how things play out. (Except for Doomblade which I specifically 
		want close to slashem levels.)
	
	Design decision #2: 
		Any roles that had 2 guaranteed altar sacrifice gifts have been reduced to just 1. 
		Having 2 just seems excessive, and most of the time, the second gift was just a barrier to overcome to
		get to better stuff (example: Deathsword for Barbarian, or even Deluder for Wizards)
		
	- [x] Players can twoweapon with an artifact in each hand, if those artifacts happen to get along with each other.
	- [x] When sacrificing, your deity may gift you a regular piece of gear instead of an artifact.
	- [x] Added much stronger artifact blasting (6d6 to 8d10) (from Slashem)
	- [x] If wielding/wearing any of the 'banes, taming becomes impossible */
	- [x] Wishing for artifacts: 
		- Instead of being based off of how many artifacts exist in the game total (vanilla NetHack method), success is based off of how many artifacts the player has wished for (successful or not). 
		- ALSO - the odds are high that it comes with its owner...

	- [x] Bat from Hell
		- Rogues no longer receive this as a guaranteed sacrifice gift.
	- [x] Deathsword

		- Raised to 10% beheading.
		- The player/hero can no longer handle thiefbane, even as a chaotic non-human...

		  the Black Market more difficult to steal from and makes more sense 
		  because, of course, Thiefbane would not respect us as thieves!

		- Switched Disrupter from being a priest sac gift to being Undead Slayer sac gift.

		- Wizards no longer receive this as a guaranteed sacrifice gift.
	- [x] Whisperfeet (Tourist sac gift)
	- [x] Gauntlets of Defense (Monk sac gift)

Dungeon Features

Trap Mechanics:
	- Breaking wands will usually create related traps (unnethack)
		Example: Breaking a wand of fire creates a fire trap.
	- Can #untrap rust traps (they turn into fountains)
	- Can #untrap fire traps (requires water)

Toilets:
	- I know toilets are a bit silly, but I have enhanced them so they are more
	interesting and useful!
	
	- Toilet info works in #overview, toilets are tracked separately from sinks now.
	- Toilets can appear separate from sinks, in slashem they only appeared in a pair with sinks.
	- Add new messages for toilets on a level
	- Enable fishing in toilets
	- Dropping a ring of poly into a sink can poly into a toilet.
	
	Toilet #pray:
		- Prevented toilet prayer while levitating.
		- Toilet prayer can now stop the vomiting process 
			(before it could not and you could vomit and still be in the vomiting process)

	Toilet #kicking:
		- Kicking now only breaks the toilet 1 in 7x on kick (Was 1/4 in slashem)
		- Kicking can generate brown puddings (only once per toilet)
		- Kicking can generate cockroaches and sewage from kicking (1 in 17 chance)
		- Kicking can generate a random tool, normally this tool will weigh under 15aum,
			but sometimes you'll get a large tool that bonks against the piping.
			If a large tool bonks 3x - you'll get that tool no matter now big it is and
			the toilet is destroyed in the process.		

	Amulet identification in toilets (From Slex)
		- Updated amulet feedback messages, blind effects, and hallucination effects.
		- Amulets of Flying are always regurgitated from toilets.
		- Amulets of Change will polymorph the toilet into a sink
	
	- [x] Toilets can generate in the middle of the room within a room type

Forges:
	Forges are introduced, which have the same appearance as fountains but are orange in color. Just like fountains, dipping things into them can have desirable or adverse affects. They can be used to dispose of anything that is flammable, and can also be used to repair corrosion/rust damage to any metallic object (if your luck is greater than 0). There is a rare chance that a lava demon can be summoned via dipping, which will be hostile most times, but can sometimes spawn tame (same odds as getting a wish from a water demon/fountain). Having negative luck can cause a forge to explode when used, which can cause considerable fire damage. Players can also use a forge to remove an attached ball & chain, and can also combine two objects to forge something new using the #forge command.
	- [x] Added new recipes for various imported weapons
	- [x] Forges don't appear until after level 5.

-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-=x=-

Mechanics:
	- [x] #force can also be used on doors
	- [x] #loot can be used at your pet to both give and take away items from its inventory.
	- [x] #borrow command (Evil has the "Thievery" skill for Rogues, and #loot for pets)

	- [x] The mysterious force has been removed.
	
	- [x] Intrinsic resistances are no longer binary, but are percentages instead. The spread is 5% to 50% resistance gained from eating per corpse. Damage reduction from various attacks is determined by how much partial resistance the player has to it.
	- [x] Reflection is not 100%; it can lessen the effects of an attack it reflects, but will never negate it.
	- [x] The "shower of missiles" monster attack is not completely negated by magic resistance.


	- [x] Upgrading mechanic (via potions of gain level from Slash'EM)
		- [x] Instead of crystal balls <-> magic markers, go lenses <-> orbs.

	- [x] Implemented "Afraid" status; 
		- The player can sometimes become too afraid to control their actions.
		- similar to the effects of being stunned or confused. 
		- Caused by dragon roars and some monster attacks.
	- [x] Add "Stable" property
		- Protects you(or monsters) from clobber and hurtle attacks.
	- [x] Added Sonic Resistance property
		- Protects you(or monsters) from sonic attacks.
	- [x] Added LarvaCarrier property - some monsters can infect you with eggs!
	
Scare Monster: 
	- Several more creatures are immune: 
		Wizard of Yendor, lawful minions, Angels, the Riders, humans, shopkeepers inside their shops, priests inside their temples, and any unique monsters. 
	- EvilHack added Archangels, honey badgers, player monsters, and anything that is mindless. 
	- Any monsters affected by conflict are also immune.

Altar sacrificing
	- Sacrificing for artifacts has been significantly changed in EvilHack/HackEM – there is a chance that your deity will gift you a regular item instead of an artifact. 
	- The odds of being gifted an artifact go up as you increase in experience level. 
	At XP 4, there's a 10% chance for an artifact gift, and the chances increment exponentially from there. 

	- Regular object gifts are either be a weapon or a piece of armor
	- For primary spellcasting roles (priest/wizard/etc), there's a chance of receiving a spellbook also. 
	The gift received will always be blessed, enchanted, fixed, and there is a 1 in 8 chance that a desirable object property will be added to that object.

	- Prayer timeout and the chances of receiving another gift are affected in the same way as if you had received an actual artifact.

Twoweaponing
	Twoweaponing has been changed so that the weight of your offhand weapon combined with your skill in twoweaponing has a significant bearing on how successful you'll be in landing a hit. As you increase your skill in twoweaponing, heavier weapons become a viable option to use in your offhand without penalty. That penalty is −30 to-hit, and you'll receive feedback stating that your offhand weapon is too heavy to wield successfully as you try to use it. Below is a listing of what weights and weapons are acceptable per your skill in twoweaponing:

	Unskilled – maximum weight of offhand weapon is 20 aum (can use tridents, javelins, crysknives, daggers, unicorn horns, or anything lighter)
	Basic – maximum weight of offhand weapon is 30 aum (can use short swords, spears, or a mace)
	Skilled – maximum weight of offhand weapon is 40 aum (can use sabers or long swords)
	Expert – maximum weight of offhand weapon is 70 aum (can offhand any one-handed weapon)
	If playing as a giant, or if wearing gauntlets of power, the maximum weight of your offhand weapon can be 200 aum, meaning you can basically offhand any normal object. Bear in mind that object materials can alter an items base weight – at basic twoweaponing skill you could offhand a normal short sword without penalty, but not a silver short sword, as silver adds extra weight compared to iron (33 aum vs 30 aum). But at the same time, a mithril katana (15 aum) would be perfectly acceptable at the same skill level as mithril is much lighter than any other metal in the game.

Conflict:
	- When causing conflict, it now takes the player's charisma score into account. 
	- The formula is 'charisma - monster level + player level' 
	- if that value is greater than 19, clamps it to be 19. 
	- There's then a percentage chance (rnd(20)) against the value generated on whether conflict kicks in or not. 
	- So even with charisma and your xp level maxed out, there's still a 5% chance of conflict not working. 
	- Also, the monsters affected have to see you for conflict to work.

Dexterity :
	- Can directly affect the player's AC, for better or worse. 
	- being encumbered, or wearing any kind of heavy metallic body armor (read: not mithril) or other rigid material (bone, stone, wood) will negate any favorable armor class bonuses from Dexterity.

Quality-of-Life/Auto-ID:
	- [x] Remove "Auto-select every item" when putting into containers
	- [x] Auto-ID for ring of regeneration
	- [x] Auto-ID jumping boots (from AceHack)

	- [x] Auto-ID dunce cap upon wearing
	- [x] Auto-ID magic lamps and oil lamps when rubbing
	- [x] Autoidentify water walking boots (when putting them on in water,etc)

Religion/Prayer/Alters:
	- Make temple priests hostile if made on an unaligned altar.
		(This means the VoTD priest is always hostile now - no free donates kiddies!)
	- Sacrifice offerings can sometimes bless random objects (From SlashEM)

	Tourist:
		- [x] Tourists get automatic type identification for shop items
	
	- [x] Add role adjusted pricing for sam/barb/rog (2-3x - from SlashEM)
	
	Twoweaponing – Barbarians go from basic to skilled, Tourists from skilled to basic. Ranger obtains twoweaponing, up to skilled.
	
	Archeologist – scimitar and club moved from skilled to basic. Spear skill added, can be trained to expert.
Barbarian – riding skill from basic to skilled. Attack spell school removed. Special spell changed to cause fear.
Caveman – all spell schools removed, has 20% chance of failing to read any spellbook, regardless of its BUC status. Can bang rocks together to make flint, can lash flint to arrows, making them more deadly. Staying illiterate can increase maximum hit point gain per level-up. Are the only role that can successfully tame and ride saber-toothed tigers.
Healer – added clerical spell school, can train to skilled. Gets poison resistance intrinsic at experience level 3 instead of experience level 1. Trades warning intrinsic for sick resistance at experience level 15. Can sense how wounded a monster is when attacking it, can also sense the wounded status of its pets.
Knight – numerous weapon skills adjusted (axe, broadsword, two-handed sword, polearms and spears from skilled to expert. Mace and morning star moved from skilled to basic). Attack and healing spell schools moved from skilled to basic. Knights can never tame dragons (they are natural enemies). Dwarven knights will start with a dwarvish bearded axe instead of a long sword.
Monk – crossbow skill removed, added trident and broadsword; tweaked skill advancement for weapons. Gains an extra fist attack per round using martial arts skill at grand master level, and also gains an extra kick attack (random) using martial arts skill at master level and higher. Can break boulders and statues using martial arts skill at skilled level or higher (press shift + f and then a movement key in the desired direction). Because of the extra random kick attack at master/grand master level, players will need to be mindful of wearing boots of some sort, as kicking a footrice/basilisk barefoot equals instant petrification. Monks now receive extra intrinsics as they level up into the higher experience tiers (telepathy at 20, water walking at 23, stoning resistance at 25, disintegration resistance at 27, and sickness resistance at 30).
Priest – all slash and pierce weapons removed; can only train with blunt-type weapons. Incurs a substantial to-hit penalty, abuses wisdom and can negatively impact alignment when trying to use an edged weapon (wielded or thrown). Their crowning gift is Mjollnir.
Ranger – if playing as a gnome, their quest artifact becomes the Crossbow of Carl. Its properties mirror that of the Longbow of Diana, except that it is a crossbow instead of a bow.
Rogue – new trainable skill known as 'thievery', which allows the rogue to pickpocket a target and steal items from their inventory (must be bare-handed to use, press shift + f and then a movement key in the direction of the target). If the target is peaceful, there is a chance the target will not notice depending on the players' skill in thievery. Critical strike from behind works while twoweaponing.
Samurai – removed attack and clerical spell schools.
Valkyrie – removed escape spell school. Special spell changed to repair armor. Dwarven valkyries will start with a dwarvish bearded axe instead of a long sword, and are automatically proficient with it when using it to disarm weapons/shields.
Wizard – removed numerous weapons from being trained (axe, short sword, club, mace, polearms, spear, trident, shuriken). Enchantment spell skill raised from skilled to expert, clerical spell skill lowered from skilled to basic. New starting pet, the pseudodragon. Can sense if objects are magical in nature, much the same way a priest knows the beatitude of all objects.


Races:
	New player races: centaur, giant, hobbit, and illithid, replete with their own special abilities and restrictions.

		- Vampires who wear an Opera cloak get a +1 Charisma bonus:

		- Can only be chaotic.
		- I tried to space out the intrinsics a bit, since it felt like vampires started out
		overpowered in Slash'EM - but also didn't benefit from Poison or Sleep that vampires
		usually enjoy.

		Level 1: Flying
				Breathless
				Drain/Death/Sickness resistance, 	
				Vulnerable to fire & silver.
		Level 5: Hunger
		Level 7: Regeneration
		Level 10: Poison resistance

The Quest
Various changes have been made to each role's Quest to make the experience more varied and interesting for the player.

The minimum experience level needed to be accepted for the quest has been lowered to 10 (from the default 14). However, should you accept the quest too soon, the monster spawn rate immediately doubles.
If you've made your quest leader angry for whatever reason, this no longer makes the game unwinnable. You can engage them in battle, and if you kill your quest leader, this unlocks the quest. You can then complete your quest as you normally would. Take heed, quest leaders are not weak and can prove formidable to a mid-level player. Also note that your deity isn't exactly thrilled with you killing off your quest leader. Your alignment record can still be in the positive, but if you try any helm of opposite alignment shenanigans when it comes time to sacrifice the Amulet of Yendor at the endgame... interesting (read: bad) things can happen.
Abusing your alignment can have a direct effect on how your quest ends. Once you've defeated the quest nemesis and returned with your quest artifact and the Bell of Opening and speak with your quest leader, there's a chance they may ask you to actually return the quest artifact as they originally alluded to when you first accepted the quest. Alignment abuse is tracked throughout the game – having your alignment negatively adjusted by one point also counts as one abuse point (this can be checked at any time via #conduct, and compared to vanilla, more feedback when abusing alignment is given). Unlike your alignment record, which can be readjusted back into positive standing, your alignment abuse record is permanent.
Getting one abuse point means there's a 1 in 50 chance your quest leader will ask you to give up the quest artifact. Racking up more abuse points increases those odds, to the point where if you've accumulated 50 or more abuse points, it's virtually guaranteed your quest leader will demand you return the quest artifact. You have two options at this point – either hand over the quest artifact peacefully, or decline. Declining will anger your quest leader, and they will attack. Handing over the quest artifact peacefully will flag the quest as complete. Declining to turn over the quest artifact does not complete the quest – at some point your quest leader will need to be defeated before the quest is flagged as complete. Also, attempting to evade your quest leader (whether they are peaceful or hostile) will do you no good in the long run, as the Bell of Opening has been 'cursed', and the only way to lift the curse is to complete the quest. The Bell will not function for the invocation until this is done.
Alternative scenarios have been taken into account, such as if you angered your quest leader before even starting the quest and you killed them, you simply need to defeat your quest nemesis to flag the quest as complete. Conversely, if you've killed the quest nemesis and return, but somehow anger your quest leader before you speak to them, killing them also flags the quest as complete. Some peace of mind – if you've never abused your alignment, your quest leader will never ask you for the quest artifact.
