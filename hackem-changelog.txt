Dragons and Dragon Scales
	Evil uses the dtsund patch for dragon scales, which means that dragon scale
	mail no longer exists - but we can apply dragon scales to any armor. Since
	robes are now body armor - we can even created dragon scaled robes! Evil 
	introduced some passive effects, I have expanded these so that every dragon 
	scale provides them. I have also switched around or added new abilities.
	Most of these abilities are from other forks, but some are my own addition.

	I wanted the Deep Dragon scales to be unique and powerful, so I specifically 
	added immunity to clobber/hurtle attacks

		- When the BoT has 0 charges, it is safe to put in a Bag of Holding.
		- Adjusted BoT #tip behavior - it stops when it reaches a non-monster effect.
		  (This is a compromize between BoT behavior between UnNethack and Evil.)

	- [x] torch
		(The slashem implementation of torches was a bit cumbersome for the player, 
		you could only have a lit torch by wielding it. I have tried to address that.)
		- Removed requirement for torches to be wielded -
			(lamps don't need to be wielded, so why would torches?)
		- Unwielding does not snuff the torch.
		- Clubs can be dipped into oil and turned into torches (from dnh)
		- Dwarves in mines frequently get lit torches now.
		- Putting lit torches into containers auto-snuffs.
	
	Lightsabers:
		- [x] green lightsaber
		- [x] blue lightsaber
		- [x] red lightsaber
		- Lit lightsabers act as a light source.
		- We can force locks and break down doors with #force

Gems:
	- [x] healthstone
		- Fixed a bug from SlashEM where healthstones would not work under level 10.
	- [x] whetstone
		- Made whetstones not suck!
		- We can now apply a stack of whetstones to a stack of weapons. 
		  (Before this was limited to applying 1 whetstone to a single object, 
		  which was cumbersome and annoying to work with.)
		- Can use (a)pply or #rub with whetstones.
		- Removed the extra penalty for artifacts (how can artifacts resist sharpening?)
		- Whetstones can now remove corrosion (in addition to rust)
		- A blessed whetstone can uncurse a weapon
		- Blessed Whetstones can enchant non-corroded, uncursed, +0 weapons up 
		  to +1. (You need to pass a coin flip after the first roll)
		- Cursed whetstones can erode/negatively enchant weapons. 
		  (Only takes 1 turn though)
		- Allow using potions of water, roll 1d7 to see if it's used up.
		- You can use whetstones in shallow water, pools, moats, sewage, 
		  rust traps, sinks, and toilets.
		- Whetstones took a long to use (too long), lowered the time a little.
		- Cavemen get mega bonus for whetstones
		- Updated usage and repair messages
		- Removed the side effects of fountains, sinks, toilets.
		  In SlashEM, using a whetstone on one of these would also activate 
		  the quaffing effects of those features. This duplicates code and also
		  adds too much complexity - after all, we're just using a tiny amount
		  of water to wet the whetstone, would a bunch of Water Moccasins pop
		  out because of that? 
	- Added more upgrade paths for gray stones. 
	- luckstones and whetstones can be upgraded into healthstones and vice versa. 
	- flintstones upgrade into luck/whetstones.

Artifacts:
	Design decision #1: 
		In SlashEM, artifacts grant a base damage bonus - should we adjust so 
		that they deal closer to that on average? Currently, we'll say no and
		see how things play out. (Except for Doomblade which I specifically 
		want close to slashem levels.)
	
	Design decision #2: 
		Any roles that had 2 guaranteed altar sacrifice gifts have been reduced to just 1. 
		Having 2 just seems excessive, and most of the time, the second gift was just a barrier to overcome to
		get to better stuff (example: Deathsword for Barbarian, or even Deluder for Wizards)

		- The player/hero can no longer handle thiefbane, even as a chaotic non-human...
		  At first this was a bug, but I decided to keep this because it makes 
		  the Black Market more difficult to steal from and makes more sense 
		  because, of course, Thiefbane would not respect us as thieves!
	- [x] Disrupter
		- Switched Disrupter from being a priest sac gift to being Undead Slayer sac gift.
		- Disrupter causes hostility to undead.
	- [x] Mirrorbright (Healer)
		- Removed Deluder from being a Healer sac gift. It clashes with their quest artifact being 2-handed.
