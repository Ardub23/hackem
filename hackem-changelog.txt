Dragons and Dragon Scales

	Evil uses the dtsund patch for dragon scales, which means that dragon scale
	mail no longer exists - but we can apply dragon scales to any armor. Evil 
	introduced some passive effects, I have expanded these so that every dragon 
	scale provides them. I have also switched around or added new abilities.
	Most of these abilities are from other forks, but some are my own addition.

	I wanted the Deep Dragon scales to be unique and powerful, so I specifically 
	added immunity to clobber/hurtle attacks

Dragon			Primary				Secondary				Passive
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Black DSM		disintegration res	<<slow digestion>>		passive disintegration attack !!
Blue DSM		shock res			confers speed			<<passive shock attack>> !!
															1d6 and critical hit of 2d24.

															1d3 and critical hit of (level + 1)d6

!! - Item destruction from attack AD_TYPE
	- Most of the passive attacks only trigger 33% of the time.
	- Black DSM also protects from engulfing digest attacks due to slow digestion? 
		  (But Not from gelatinous cubes because they have a engulf wrap attack)
	- [SKIPPED] Sea DSM prevents engulfing by firey monsters also.

		- We can now apply a stack of whetstones to a stack of weapons. 
		  (Before this was limited to applying 1 whetstone to a single object, 
		  which was cumbersome and annoying to work with.)
		- Can use (a)pply or #rub with whetstones.
		- Removed the extra penalty for artifacts (how can artifacts resist sharpening?)
		- Whetstones can now remove corrosion (in addition to rust)
		- A blessed whetstone can uncurse a weapon
		- Blessed Whetstones can enchant non-corroded, uncursed, +0 weapons up 
		  to +1. (You need to pass a coin flip after the first roll)
		- Cursed whetstones can erode/negatively enchant weapons. 
		  (Only takes 1 turn though)
		- Allow using potions of water, roll 1d7 to see if it's used up.
		- You can use whetstones in shallow water, pools, moats, sewage, 
		  rust traps, sinks, and toilets.
		- Whetstones took a long to use (too long), lowered the time a little.
		- Cavemen get mega bonus for whetstones
		- Updated usage and repair messages
		- Removed the side effects of fountains, sinks, toilets.
		  In SlashEM, using a whetstone on one of these would also activate 
		  the quaffing effects of those features. This duplicates code and also
		  adds too much complexity - after all, we're just using a tiny amount
		  of water to wet the whetstone, would a bunch of Water Moccasins pop
		  out because of that? 

		- [SKIPPED] Applying whetstone to water: You make scratch marks on the stones.
		- [SKIPPED] bonus: whetstoning with holy or unholy water. Dips BOTH the weapon and the whetstone.




Artifacts:
	Design decision: 
		In SlashEM, artifacts grant a base damage bonus - should we adjust so 
		that they deal closer to that on average? Currently, we'll say no and
		see how things play out. (Except for Doomblade which I specifically 
		want close to slashem levels.)
