Left out from slashem import:
	- Doctor Frankenstein/Frankenstein's Monster
		Left out Frankenstein's level. I always felt this one was either not designed well, or just didn't fit into the game. It also makes searching for Vlad's more annoying.
	- Gypsy - too complex to integrate. This NPC is imbalanced in the way that players might try to take advantage of the infinite wish trick - which is just degenerate. There is also an issue with the term "Gypsy" in that it's used in a derogatory fashion in some countries for the Roma culture.
	- Pegasus (evil already has pegasi). 
			And Pegasus doesn't do much in slashem except pop out of Medusa.
	- Rat King - Removed and kept Evil's Rat King instead.

		  (Eventually I might add in female counterparts, but I don't want to

Dragons and Dragon Scales
	Evil uses the dtsund patch for dragon scales, which means that dragon scale
	mail no longer exists - but we can apply dragon scales to any armor. Evil 
	introduced some passive effects, I have expanded these so that every dragon 
	scale provides them. I have also switched around or added new abilities.
	Most of these abilities are from other forks, but some are my own addition.

	I wanted the Deep Dragon scales to be unique and powerful, so I specifically 
	added immunity to clobber/hurtle attacks

Dragon			Primary				Secondary				Passive
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Black DSM		disintegration res	<<slow digestion>>		passive disintegration attack !!
Blue DSM		shock res			confers speed			<<passive shock attack>> !!
															1d6 and critical hit of 2d24.

Orange DSM		sleep res			<<free action>>			<<passive sleep attack>>
Red DSM			fire res			+1d6 melee damage, 		passive fire attack !!
Shimmering DSM	displacement		stealth, warn, see inv	<<passive confusion/stunning/slow>>

White DSM		cold res			freeze water/lava walk	passive cold attack !!

															1d3 and critical hit of (level + 1)d6

!! - Item destruction from attack AD_TYPE
	- Most of the passive attacks only trigger 33% of the time.
	- Black DSM also protects from engulfing digest attacks due to slow digestion? 
		  (But Not from gelatinous cubes because they have a engulf wrap attack)
	- [SKIPPED] Sea DSM prevents engulfing by firey monsters also.

		- We can force locks and break down doors with #force
		- Putting a lit lightsaber into a bag/container snuffs it.
		- [SKIPPED] Lightsabers don't dig down. Not supported.
		
		- [x] Green lightsaber
		- [x] Blue lightsaber
		- [x] Red lightsaber

	 
	- [x] Pick-axe: Changed weight to 75 aum (From SLASH'EM)

Gems:
	- [x] Healthstone
		- Fixed a bug from SlashEM where healthstones would not work under level 10.
	- [x] Whetstone
		- Made whetstones not suck!
		- We can now apply a stack of whetstones to a stack of weapons. 
		  (Before this was limited to applying 1 whetstone to a single object, 
		  which was cumbersome and annoying to work with.)
		- Can use (a)pply or #rub with whetstones.
		- Removed the extra penalty for artifacts (how can artifacts resist sharpening?)
		- Whetstones can now remove corrosion (in addition to rust)
		- A blessed whetstone can uncurse a weapon
		- Blessed Whetstones can enchant non-corroded, uncursed, +0 weapons up 
		  to +1. (You need to pass a coin flip after the first roll)
		- Cursed whetstones can erode/negatively enchant weapons. 
		  (Only takes 1 turn though)
		- Allow using potions of water, roll 1d7 to see if it's used up.
		- You can use whetstones in shallow water, pools, moats, sewage, 
		  rust traps, sinks, and toilets.
		- Whetstones took a long to use (too long), lowered the time a little.
		- Cavemen get mega bonus for whetstones
		- Updated usage and repair messages
		- Removed the side effects of fountains, sinks, toilets.
		  In SlashEM, using a whetstone on one of these would also activate 
		  the quaffing effects of those features. This duplicates code and also
		  adds too much complexity - after all, we're just using a tiny amount
		  of water to wet the whetstone, would a bunch of Water Moccasins pop
		  out because of that? 

		- [SKIPPED] Applying whetstone to water: You make scratch marks on the stones.
		- [SKIPPED] bonus: whetstoning with holy or unholy water. Dips BOTH the weapon and the whetstone.

Artifacts:
	Design decision #1: 
		In SlashEM, artifacts grant a base damage bonus - should we adjust so 
		that they deal closer to that on average? Currently, we'll say no and
		see how things play out. (Except for Doomblade which I specifically 
		want close to slashem levels.)
	
	Design decision #2: 
		Any roles that had 2 guaranteed altar sacrifice gifts have been reduced to just 1. 
		Having 2 just seems excessive, and most of the time, the second gift was just a barrier to overcome to
		get to better stuff (example: Deathsword for Barbarian, or even Deluder for Wizards)
		
	- [x] Added much stronger artifact blasting (6d6 to 8d10) (from Slashem)

		- Changed Thiefbane to platinum so elves can wield it.

		- The player/hero can no longer handle thiefbane, even as a chaotic non-human...
		  At first this was a bug, but I decided to keep this because it makes 
		  the Black Market more difficult to steal from and makes more sense 
		  because, of course, Thiefbane would not respect us as thieves!
	- [x] Disrupter
		- Switched Disrupter from being a priest sac gift to being Undead Slayer sac gift.

		- Kicking can generate brown puddings (only once per toilet)

		- Kicking can generate a random tool, normally this tool will weigh under 15aum,

			the toilet is destroyed in the process.

	* The black market always has full id services, appraisal, and uncursing services.
	* Lighting stores and general tool shops can both charge all types of tools.
	* Only wand shops can offer premier charging
	
	Basic: Just identifies the type of an object; Doesn't reveal BUC/charges/contents	
	Premium: Completely identify an object ( like a scroll of identify)
	Appraisal (saying how much damage a weapon does),
		* told the basic dmg your weapon does vs small and large foes. 
		* General shk have a 1/10 chance of not being able to tell you anything,
		  a 1/10 chance of not being sure about small foes, 
		  and a 1/10 chance of not being sure about large foes.
